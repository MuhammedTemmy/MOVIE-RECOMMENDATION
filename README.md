# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION
Building a personalized movie recommender system research report final copy
 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Movie recommendation systems have become significantly more important as the popularity 
of online streaming platforms has increased. Streaming platforms possess rich libraries of 
movies and TV shows, making it difficult for users of the platform to navigate through and find 
content that is like those they prefer (Hastie, 2019).
Movie recommendation systems are built primarily to solve this problem by making relevant 
and personalized movie recommendations to the user based on their preferences, past viewing 
history and demographics. These accurate and tailored recommendations are produced by these 
systems using machine learning techniques as well as advanced algorithms, the use of which 
not only helps users discover new movies but helps retain and satisfy users on the streaming 
platform (Koren, Bell and Volinsky, 2009).
The large volume of content presently available on streaming platforms is one of the reasons 
why movie recommendation systems are needed. Netflix, for example, offers thousands of 
movies and shows, which without a recommendation system, would have to be manually 
combed through by the user in search of other movies, resulting in time wastage and potentially 
being overwhelmed (Bobadilla et al., 2012).
Existing movie recommendation systems use various approaches, including collaborative 
filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods. Collaborative filtering involves the 
analysis of user behavior and preferences to identify similar users and recommend movies 
based on a blend of their collective preferences (Sarwar et al., 2001). Content-based filtering 
involves the analysis of the attributes of movies themselves, such as genre, actors, and 
directors, to recommend similar movies to users (Pazzani & Billsus, 2007. Hybrid methods 
involve the combination of both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to provide 
more accurate and diverse recommendations (Burke, 2002).
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Movie recommendation systems are faced with several challenges despite the growth in that 
area of technology. The cold start problem is one of the challenges that movie recommendation 
systems must deal with. This challenge occurs when there is insufficient data either for a new 
user (no viewing history or preferences) or new movie with insufficient data (attributes). 
Accurate recommendations are difficult to make in this case. The sparsity problem which is 
10
little interactions between users and the movies on the platforms making pattern identification 
and therefore accurate recommendations almost impossible (Schein et al., 2002; Koren, Bell 
and Volinsky, 2009).
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system that solves the cold start problem 
and the sparsity by allowing the user to input the name of any movie they have watched and 
enjoyed. The system would then generate recommendations for the user. 
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
 # AIMS
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using machine learning 
techniques and advanced algorithms which will overcome these challenges. The research aims 
to study and incorporate deep learning and matrix factorization into the design of the system to 
enable it to capture the dynamic nature of user preferences.
# OBJECTIVES
This project has as its primary objective the development of a movie recommendation system 
using Python and machine learning techniques. This recommendation system will be built 
using the MovieLens Dataset and will apply machine learning algorithms to generate 
personalized recommendations of movies. Ratings, movie details and tags will be used to create 
this system and ensure its accuracy.
The objectives also include:
1. Utilization of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques
2. Evaluation and comparison of different machine learning algorithms.
3. Preprocessing and analysis of the MovieLens Dataset.
4. Design and implementation of a website with user-friendly interface to enable users to 
interact with the recommendation system.
5. Evaluation of the recommendation system’s performance.
# PROCESS
The execution of this project will be done systematically. The steps involved will be broken 
down in this section.
Firstly, the MovieLens Dataset will be downloaded and preprocessed to make the data ready 
for training the model as well as evaluating it. The preprocessing techniques conducted will 
11
ensure that there are no missing values, that the data is normalized and of the required quality 
for the development of the system.
Having prepared the data, the focus will move to the design and architecture of the 
recommendation system. The system will be built in modules, each handling specific tasks 
such as data processing, feature extraction, and recommendation generation. The system 
workflow will be defined to outline the sequence of operations and interactions between the 
modules.
Then, the implementation phase will begin. This will involve the selection and training of the 
machine learning models for the recommendation system. Algorithms such as matrix 
factorization, neural networks and ensemble methods will be explored to evaluate their effect 
on the recommendation system’s performance in generating relevant and accurate 
recommendations. The model(s) built will then be trained using the preprocessed data, and 
appropriate evaluation metrics will be employed to evaluate their performance.
The project will also focus on the user interface design and implementation. A user-friendly 
website will be developed to allow users to interact with the recommendation system easily. 
The interface will provide options for users to input their preferences (a movie they enjoyed 
watching) and receive recommendations on similar movies.
The effectiveness of the recommendations will be evaluated using the experimental results as 
well as the feedback from the users who will be given a form to fill in their feedback and 
evaluation of the system after interacting with it. Performance evaluation metrics such as 
precision, recall, and mean average precision will also be used to assess the accuracy and 
relevance of the recommendations. Users’ satisfaction will also be considered as a significant 
measure of the system’s effectiveness.
